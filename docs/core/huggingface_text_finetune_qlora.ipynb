In QloRA, the pretrained model is quantized to 4-bit and the weights are frozen. Then trainable adapter layers (LoRA) are attached and only the adapter layers are trained. Afterwards, the adapter weights can be merged with the base model or kept as a separate adapter.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Fine-tune a natural language to SQL model for seamless integration into a data analysis tool. The objective is to significantly reduce the time and expertise required for SQL query generation, enabling even non-technical users to extract meaningful insights from data.\n",
